# MEPs-speeches
A Python 3 script for downloadind the MEPs speeches. 
In the current version, the program downloads the first 100 speeches per person, and if the number of speeches is higher, it writes the names and the links of these MEPs in a file "Missing data".
It's related to difficulties with dealing with a Java-script in the website of the EU Parliament.
